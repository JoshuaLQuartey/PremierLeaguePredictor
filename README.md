# PremierLeaguePredictor

# Introduction
This is my Premier league predictor project, which encompassed data scraping and the application of advanced machine learning techniques. Through the collection and analysis of data, I constructed a model capable of generating predictions for the outcomes of matches in the Premier League. The model was trained to identify patterns, derive insights, and make accurate forecasts based on the scraped data. Upon comparing the projected standings with the actual league table, I drew insightful conclusions regarding the predictability of the Premier League.
